# ipc2023-domains

## Licenses
Most of the domains in the IPC 2023 are copies of the domains from the [IPC 2020](https://github.com/panda-planner-dev/ipc2020-domains).
In some domains we generated new larger instances.

Four domains (Lamps and SharpSAT in total-order and Colouring and Ultralight-Cockpit in partial-order) are new.
